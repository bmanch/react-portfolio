            I spent the first twenty-three years of my life in Southern California. In 2010, I moved to the other coast, taking up residence in Durham, North Carolina. I studied religion and classics during my undergraduate years at Biola University. I then continued studying religion at Duke University, where I obtained a Master’s degree in 2013. For work, I have primarily been involved in the test prep industry since 2009. Besides tutoring and teaching courses for high schoolers for the SAT and the ACT (among other subjects), I also spent time writing curriculum, serving as a school liaison, and much more. Having spent the majority of my life in the humanities—and, therefore, in the realm of abstract ideas—I decided in January, 2017, that I wanted to apply my skills with logic and language to a concrete realm: web applications. Thus began my coding journey. I enrolled in a coding bootcamp hosted by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. I learned a lot from the course and am excited to keep learning through work and as an autodidact.

            When I'm not coding or teaching, I enjoy time with my spouse, Kat, who herself is pursuing a career as a Certified Nurse Midwife (aka, “baby catcher”). The two of us are kept busy by our Siberian Husky, Jax. For fun, I like to read, watch shows (particularly period pieces and sci-fi), and watch sports (especially basketball). I also like to play basketball, jog, drum, and climb. I’m always looking for laughs and good conversation, something I hope to find in work as well as in life.
